A collection of code I found myself repeating and recommending to other modders

includes:
A system to easily apply shaders to things drawn in multiple parts, and/or apply multiple shaders to one thing (ShaderLayerTargetHandler)
A strikethrough font which matches the character spacing of the MouseText font
A faster alternative to accessing fields through reflection (FastFieldInfo and FastStaticFieldInfo)
Automatic asset loading (AutoLoadingAsset)
Custom drawing while using or holding an item (ICustomDrawItem)
Various collision methods (CollisionExt)
